A2TC's autosplitter but with like 20 more lines that adds first input starts :)

To use the first input timing functionality, set the 'Start Input" keybind to the first key you press in a run (probably w) and 'Pause' to any key you dont normally use. Press your pause key to prevent the splitter from starting each time you press your first input. You can see the status of the first input detection above the active splits box. You can still manually start or split while paused or running with the dedicated keybind if you wish.
